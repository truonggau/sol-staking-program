# SPL Staking Program

## ProjectðŸ’¡

*Project title*: SPL Staking Program

*Fund*: $3,500

At the current state, there are many available staking programs on the Solana network. However, none of them allows developers to create pool staking with arbitrary SPL-token simply and securely. In this project, we propose the SPL Staking Program, an open-source program supporting all SPL-token. The main novel features of our program are:
  - Provide multi renting mode which adapt realistic requirements from many project.
  - Provide SDK and CLI for smooth integration of the program.
  - Minimize cost to operate staking pool and provides comprehensive documentation for developer to deploy and upgrade the program.
  - Provide an integrated UI for developers for easy-to-deploy of the staking pool.
 
About our development members, we are a team of two experienced developers with much experience developing â€‹â€‹Dapp on Solana. Some of the representative projects are:

1. Staking Dapp for Starbots
  * Program Address: https://solscan.io/account/FDVR5rp6F5arSfew3qGkPmxMEduenZ9u6EbEob75RTGB
  * UI: https://staking.starbots.net/

2. Assembling NFT Robots for Starbots
  * Program Address: https://solscan.io/account/BjMdQhxpgSMmesdhc7qZuUjyRgrNCkAmmhLkphDhPaAD
  * UI: https://dashboard.starbots.net/


3. Renting NFT
  * Program Address: https://solscan.io/account/F8kmuz7gpv6eFpNSFiAnDoRmmLbkENT6DtrbL2L2CXoX
  * UI: https://www.solplay.io/

Besides, we also attended the Solana Codecamp Vietnam 2022 and got the third-prize for the Solplay applications.

We propose three milestone goals in our project. We will spend the funds on the first milestone, and if it satisfies the requirement, we would like to continue applying for the next milestone. 

*Milestones 1*:

- Research staking solutions and common demands of developer

- Develop a program to match the demands.

- Develop SDK, and CLI to interact with the program

- Build comprehensive documentation and tutorial videos for the program. 

*Milestones 2*:

- Develop and add new rents
- Build reinforcement algorithms giving reward tokens

*Milestones 3*:

- Develop and add more new rents
- Develop a UI version by using React so that developers can create skiing pools easily.
